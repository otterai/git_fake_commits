## ✏️ Variables to Customize

Here’s how to tailor the script to your needs:

- **`start_date`**: The starting date for commits.
- **`end_date`**: The ending date for commits.
- **`min_commits`**: Minimum commits per day.
- **`max_commits`**: Maximum commits per day.

Example:

```python
start_date = datetime(2023, 1, 1)
end_date = datetime(2023, 1, 10)
min_commits = 1
max_commits = 5
skipping = True
max_skip_days = 2
